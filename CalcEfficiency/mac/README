My intent for this package is the following:
On BNB nu :
0) With SignalEff : Calculate number of CCpi0 in BNB nu sample, same on selection2 sample
   The first run gives us the number of events we should expect, the second gives us the 
   efficiency of Selection2 on our signal event.

1) Run Hit-Removal on Selection2 sample.  This will give me the same sample with extra info
   about the hits

2) Run FilterHitRatio on output of 1. This module will remove events with hit ratios below 
   some threshold and calculate both the efficiency of the removal, and purity of the final sample

   The combined efficiencies give us selection eff

3) Run Clustering, showerreconstruction, ertool on output of 2-- how many events do we snag (correctly)
   vs how many we started with? 

   This gives us our reconstruction efficiency

On Cosmic data (need to have pandora vertices):
0) Run Hit-Removal on cosmics data
1) Run Filter on output of 0.  Hopefully there aren't too many pandora vertices, so we don't snag too many
2) Run Reconstruction-- do we grab any pi0s?

Further, need to understand :
0) Which signal cuts to use for pi0 selection (angle, IP, radL,mass?)
1) Energy loss associated with each step of reconstruction, if I use pi0 mass peak as signal cut
2) Other?
